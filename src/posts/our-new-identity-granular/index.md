We have all been there. You stay up all night preparing the presentation for
your monthly marketing review and you show up thinking you have every question
covered, until that one person in the meeting who asks a seemingly innocuous
question that has you dumbfounded like “What were the best performing creatives
and can you break it down by retention and prospecting?” Or “It’s great that you
have day wise data but can you roll it up by weeks and compare it to the
previous month?” Not so easy huh?

This is what Marketing reports looked like in 2004 when I started in my first
job.

Fast forward to 2018 and here is what they look like today…

Not much different is it? Despite rapidly proliferating platforms, channels and
analytics; the way we look at data and the tools we have at our disposal have
been the same.

We wanted to build a product to help marketers manage their ever increasing data
sources. This is not a new problem and many have tried to tackle it in the past.
Unfortunately the solutions are far from adequate, marketers are either stuck
with little widgets which are painfully inadequate or investing in a small army
of engineers + analysts to build a data warehouse and then layering a BI
interface to view this data.

When we started exploring this problem pretty much every marketer we spoke to
agreed that the problem was valid but were divided on the solutions. Many
recommended just sticking to building data pipelines and letting companies use
existing BI products like Tableau to visualise their data.

Our goal though was a lot more ambitious. We wanted to enable true self service
Analytics for Marketers, as the constant back and forth between Marketing and
data teams could only be solved by letting Marketers have control of their data.

To enable self-service analytics we realised that the ideal way to tackle this
problem is not to look at the interface and data store as independent pieces but
as one integrated solution. This would allow us to build a product which was
contextual for marketers and also powerful enough to help them really play
around with their data without ever worrying about learning SQL or worrying
about inner joins, outer joins or n+1 queries. It was a risky choice for a
startup as we were going after multiple categories at once. Data Collection,
Data Clean-up, Warehouses and Visualization, but we decided to swing for the
fences.

We put together an MVP and worked with a couple of early customers who were
extremely savvy and demanding. They were excited with our vision and were
patient enough to work with us as we worked through the glitches and ironing out
the product and even pay us for it!

While the product “worked” we knew there was more work to be done before we
could roll it out to a larger group of customers. For the last couple of months
we have been hard at work and we are finally ready to launch.

While it’s hard to remain objective we are incredibly proud of what we built and
we can’t wait to share it with you. We are calling it Granular.

The success of Coda and Airtable tells us that strong incumbents can be
challenged and they have been a great source of inspiration for us.

On to some details!

We didn’t marketers to live in a world of compromises. If you wanted granular
data you had to go to Excel or Google Sheets, want to create charts or
visualisation switch to Google Data Studio or Tableau. Have a monthly review? Go
to Powerpoint and spend a day pasting creatives and other data points.

We really wanted to go after these limitations.

* It’s the most powerful table outside of a spreadsheet. Want to roll up day wise
  data to weeks, months or quarter? Easy peasy.
* Want to actually look at the creatives running on your channels and break down
  performance by region, audience or campaigns? Done and done!
* Would you like to see FB Pixel No.s and compare with Google Analytics/BigQuery
  or Appsflyer all in one table? You got it!
* Want to create your own metrics to see how you are measuring up to your monthly
  targets? All in one place.

We built powerful collaboration as well. For example, you can now automatically
schedule creative reports that are auto-updated so your design team can really
tell the impact of adding a call to action.

All this with the confidence that all your data across all channels is being
piped in at the most granular level automagically mapped to your web or mobile
analytics channels or internal transaction DB. To ensure you have real time view
of your data, we auto-update data at 15/30 min intervals.

We are confident you will enjoy working with Granular and while it would be
presumptuous to say that we have are the best product out there for marketing
reporting, if you do decide to give Granular a spin, we are sure you will
appreciate the level of detail that went into building it.

We are working with a mix of clients like one of the world’s largest performance
agency, some of the fastest growing e-tailers, education and streaming
providers. The fact that our customers come from different categories and
regions tells us that we are solving a global problem, if you want to give us a
go, [write to us](mailto:sales@granularhq.com)!
