![Illustration of data gravity for applications and services

")

Dave McCrory first introduced the concept of [Data
Gravity](https://blog.mccrory.me/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/) back in
2010, referring to Salesforce’s Database.com launch. The big idea of data
gravity in his own words is —

> As data accumulates (builds mass) there is a greater likelihood that additional
> services and applications will be attracted to this data. This is the same
> effect gravity has on objects around a planet. As the mass or density increases,
> so does the strength of gravitational pull.

That’s sounds interesting in theory, but what does it mean in real life? As the
volume of data generated grows exponentially, due to the [Von Neumann
bottleneck](http://wiki.c2.com/?VonNeumannBottleneck) it becomes critical for
applications to head towards the location of data storage in order to maximize
throughput and reduce latency. And just like the gravitational pull increases as
the mass is higher, applications that are close to the data have increasing
value as its volume increases.

Historically, since enterprise data was primarily stored locally Tableau was
built as a desktop application. However, as enterprises now move away from
on-prem to cloud storage, keeping the BI Platform and data store separate adds
latency and slows down performance.

To optimize for performance, cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft have
begun to adapt and launched their own BI Applications like Amazon’s QuickSight
and Microsoft’s PowerBI. These solutions sit right on top of the data and
perform a lot better than legacy solutions.

In a world where marketing leaders will spend more than **$100 billion** by 2019
on search, display, social, and email marketing — a figure that surpasses
broadcast and cable television spend
([Source](https://www.recode.net/2014/11/17/12064372/the-marketing-industry-has-a-big-data-problem))
— marketing data is probably the most massive of all! It’s surprising that a
majority of performance marketing leaders still rely on solutions like Tableau
that were never built for marketing, and sit multiple levels away.

There are multiple problems with Tableau. First, though Tableau has led the wave
in data visualization, latency issues that arise from cloud deployments can
severely hinder its ability to handle large marketing datasets. As the volume of
data increases and real-time performance insights require more and more pulls,
the latency will add up
([Source](https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/too-much-data-strikes-a-blow-to-tableau/)).
**Insights have a quick expiry**, which renders Tableau a severely handicapped
solution for marketers’ needs.

There’s a second, deeper problem with Tableau. It boils down to the **power of
context**. Consider you are presented with an extension-less file — DSC0001. If
you open it with a text editor, all you would see is junk values which don’t
make sense. But, in the text dump you notice the words — Canon PowerShot. You
guess that this is an image file and add the extension .jpg. Now you can see the
actual image! That’s one layer of context — understanding that cameras generate
.jpg files.

Let us add another layer of context — you upload the file to Google Photos. It
recognizes and automatically shows metadata like dimensions, resolution, f-stop,
shutter speed, ISO, etc. Now you not only have the image, but also a host of
information that will allow you to understand why the photo looks the way it
does. Is it too blurry? You can take one look at the shutter speed and
understand why.

" />

Data by itself is useless. Applications need depth of context, in order to help
marketers make sense out of it. **Adding context is what turns data into useful
information**, which when combined with prior knowledge can help facilitate
action. And this is exactly where Tableau, and even QuickSight and PowerBI fall
flat. As BI tools that are horizontal solutions, they can ingest any dataset.
But only an application with context can understand that quality score cannot
simply be summed up, it needs to be treated as a weighted average.

Until now marketers have been forced to adapt their workflows to fit in BI tools
that are slow, cross-functional and controlled by IT. Instead of a **fast,
flexible marketing-centered application that’s built to empower the existing
workflows of marketers**. Hence the case for one that not only sits right where
the data is, but also has all of the marketing context built-in — to work with
Marketing that is always-on rather than BI systems which were built primarily
for historical analysis.

**That’s exactly what we at Granular are building.** Some of the largest
data-driven companies and agencies around the world have been able to transform
the way they leverage their marketing data, using Granular. To know more, [get
